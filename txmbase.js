/*	Class: TXMBase
		
		Proposed base class for TransformativeMed web components. The objectives of the base class are as follows:
			1. Provide a common structure and organization for child components to follow.
			2. Reduce repetitive 'boiler plate' code contained in the child components.
			3. Encourage adoption of best practices and functionality of modern JS development and frameworks (e.g., templating, one-way data binding, no explicit DOM manipulations, etc).
			4. Reduce level of effort required by non-author devs to understand and maintain components.
			5. Allow for easy re-factors of the legacy TransformativeMed code base.
		
		It is expected that this base class will be expanded to accomodate the needs of different web applications. The base class code below should therefore
		be considered 'core functionality' -- it is entirely allowable to expand upon, but not overwrite, the methods and properties below.
	
		In order to make use of this base class, child components must extend the base class in this manner (where CMAddTask is the name of the child component class):
		
			// Derived from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create
			CMAddTask.prototype = Object.create(TXMBase.prototype);
			CMAddTask.prototype.constructor = CMAddTask;
	
	Parameters:
		
		className - String, the name of the child component class (e.g., CMAddTask) that instantiated the base class. This is useful for debugging when the error occurs
					inside the base class. Logging the className will tell you which class instantiated the base class and generated the error.
		
		defaults - Object, a variety of default options and preferences, see below:
			{
				// Array of strings, templates is an array containing all of the templates used by the component. allows for devs returning to the code later to 
				// quickly learn which templates are necessary for the component to run
				"templates":["t4m_tpl_add_task_list","t4m_tpl_add_task_list_item"]
				
				// String, loadingTemplate is the template used by the component to return a temporary loading message or spinner. if set to null, then an empty <div></div> element is used
				,"loadingTemplate":"t4m_tpl_component_loading"
				
				// Array of objects, 
					- method: the method that should be invoked when the component initializes itself
					- preventRender: optional, set to true if the method must return before the component can render itself, else the component can render before the method returns
					- condition: optional, must return true if the method is to be executed. if not supplied, then the method also executes. if false, then the method is not executed. 
				,"initList":[{"method":"_fetchTeamCoverage"
								
								,"preventRender":true
								
								// only fetch the list of teams for this service if a team list was 
								// not provided to the constructor during initialization
								,"condition":function() {
									return (self.data.teams.length == 0 && typeof self.data.code !== "number"); 
								}
							}]
				
				// Object, data is all the data that is required for the component to render itself. by default, data will most often be set to null because the component must first  
				// retrieve and store the data it needs to render via the this.init() method. however, options.data does allow the user to pre-populate data.
				,"data":null
				
				// Object, dictates what part of the rendered component should be updated when a given data change occurs. Each property on this object
				// corresponds to a property on this.data. In the example below, a change to data.participant_list will trigger refreshes of .t4m-jq-cm-convo-participant-container and
				// .t4m-jq-cm-create-convo-send-btn while a change to person_id will trigger a full refresh of the entire component. Please see the this.uiBindings property below for more details.
				,uiBindings":{
						"participant_list":[".t4m-jq-cm-convo-participant-container",".t4m-jq-cm-create-convo-send-btn"]
						,"person_id":true
					}
					
				// Object, dictates which 'fetch' methods should be executed when a change occurs to a given value on this.data. 
				// In the example below, a change to this.data.person_id will trigger the method this._fetchPersonList. The fetch methods are defined by the
				// child component. The "delayRefresh":true tells the component that we should not refresh the component until the fetch method completes and 
				// the new data has been retrieved. It will also trigger a modal loading cover/spinner preventing any user input while the new data is being retrieved.
				,"dataBindings":{
				
					// if person_id changes, invoke this._fetchPersonList, true means that will blur component while data is fetched
					"person_id":{
						"methods":["_fetchPersonList"]
						,"delayRefresh":true	
					} 
				}
				
				// If delayInit is set to true, then the component will not automatically initialize itself (i.e., fetch data) in the constructor.
				,"delayInit":false
			}
			
		data - Object, this is the data that the component uses to render itself. The component should require no other data to render itself. During the 
				initialization of the component, data is often just null -- the data must first be retrieved via XHR (see the _fetch* methods). But even if the data is null, 
				it's helpful to map out here what values are expected to be populated later. This gives other developers a blueprint of what model data this 
				component works with. Example:
				
				{
					"selected":false  // true if this team is selected
					,"full_name": null //"Berger-ONA, TTJessica",
					,"person_id": null // 14850867.000000
					,"mobile_messaging_enabled_ind": null // 0
					,"num_patients": null // 6
				}
		
		options - Object, optional, overrides the defaults by merging on top of it.
